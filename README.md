# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to creat a simple and functional webpage detailing my prework study guide. I was motivated to see how well I could grasp the new topics discussed throughout these modules and adapt them to each task. I built this project to help develop a basic understanding of the topics that I will learn in-depth in the fullstack program. This also provided a way to study the material while applying new skills.
